<!-- Data Information -->
## Data Information

  This dataset was found on NASA’s Earth Data library, and originated from the National Center for
Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado. It contains the historical climate information of Alaska based
on an annual 1% increase in greenhouse gases. Based on this historical data, future anticipated data is also
included. This dataset begins on 01 January, 1997, and has a time step of 1 month between each data point.
The climate information in this dataset includes the variables of irradiation, precipitation, minimum and
maximum temperature, relative humidity, vapor pressure, solar radiation, as well as the cartesian
coordinates and bounds for each line of data. Before manipulating, this dataset contains 7,7547,904 rows
and 14 columns. As there are many NaN values present, the data set will need to be filtered so the outliers
can be identified and the length can be reduced.

<!-- Hypothesis -->
## Hypothesis

It’s hypothesized that with the 1% increase in greenhouse gasses each year, there will be an increased amount of solar radiation over time, resulting in
higher minimum and maximum temperatures, less precipitation, greater humidity, and an increased vapor pressure over time.
